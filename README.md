# Distribution List management tool

This is a tool that was created for managing thousands of internal requests to apply changes to internal distribution lists. These changes were for removing or adding members, or removing or adding owners. This tool would utilize our ticketing system, powershell data, exchange server, and internal request system. Using all of these tools combined, it was able to validate the approval for each request and apply the changes as needed.

The information in the code for this has been modified, including values and variable names, in order to protect company information and for security.
